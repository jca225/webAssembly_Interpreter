/**
 * Scanner is responsible for taking a string that is the source code of a
 * program, and transforming it into a stream of tokens.
 *
 * [CSE 262] It is tempting to think "if my code doesn't crash when I give it
 * good input, then I have done a good job". However, a good scanner needs to be
 * able to handle incorrect programs. The bare minimum is that the scanner
 * should not crash if the input is invalid. Even better is if the scanner can
 * print a useful diagnostic message about the point in the source code that was
 * incorrect. Best, of course, is if the scanner can somehow "recover" and keep
 * on scanning, so that it can report additional syntax errors.
 *
 * [CSE 262] **In this class, "even better" is good enough for full credit**
 *
 * [CSE 262] With that said, if you make a scanner that can report multiple
 * errors, I'll give you extra credit. But you'll have to let me know that
 * you're doing this... I won't check for it on my own.
 *
 * [CSE 262] This is the only java file that you need to edit in p1. The
 * reference solution has ~240 lines of code (plus 43 blank lines and ~210 lines
 * of comments). Your code may be longer or shorter... the line-of-code count is
 * just a reference.
 *
 * [CSE 262] You are allowed to add private methods and fields to this class.
 * You may also add imports.
